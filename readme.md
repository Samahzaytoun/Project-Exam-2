# Holidaze Accommodation Booking Application

This project aims to develop a modern front-end accommodation booking application for Holidaze, a newly launched accommodation booking site. The goal of this project is to showcase the candidate's development capabilities, both in terms of visual design and technical skills. The project involves building two main components: the customer-facing side of the website for users to book holidays at venues, and the admin-facing side for managing venues and bookings.

## Goal

The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly and visually appealing front-end application for Holidaze. The finished product should demonstrate the candidate's proficiency in web development, including the ability to work with APIs and deliver a polished user experience. The project provides an opportunity to apply the skills acquired over the past two years to a real-world scenario.

## Brief

Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front-end for their accommodation booking site. While they have provided a list of required features, the design and user experience have not been specified, giving you creative freedom to plan, design, and build the application based on the official API documentation.

The project consists of two main aspects:

### 1. Customer-Facing Website

The customer-facing side of the website is the public interface where users can search for and book holidays at various venues. This part of the application should provide an intuitive and engaging user experience, allowing users to easily find and select accommodation options based on their preferences. Some of the features to be implemented in this section may include:

- Venue search functionality
- Display of venue details, including images, descriptions, amenities, and pricing , Rating
- Availability calendar for each venue
- Booking functionality and reservation management
- User registration and login

### 2. Admin-Facing Website

The admin-facing side of the website is a secure section for registered users with administrative privileges. This section allows the management of venues and bookings. The admin interface should provide the necessary tools to efficiently handle venue information and bookings. Some features that could be included in this section are:

- Venue management (add, edit, delete venues)
- Booking management (view, modify, cancel bookings)


## Technologies and Tools

The project will utilize the following technologies and tools:

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Vite: A fast development build tool for modern web applications.
- npm: A package manager for installing and managing project dependencies.
- API: The official API documentation can be found at [https://nf-api.onrender.com/docs/json](https://nf-api.onrender.com/docs/json).
- HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript: The foundational technologies for web development.
- Git: Version control system for tracking changes and collaborating with others.

Feel free to explore additional libraries and tools to enhance the development process and improve the user experience.
